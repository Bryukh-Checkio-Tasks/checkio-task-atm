    <p>Sofia found Stephen working in the garden.</p>

    <p>“Stephen!” she shouted.</p>

    <p>“No.” he replied gloomily.</p>

    <p>“What was that?”</p>

    <p>“I said NO! I won’t do it!” Stephen repeated again as he stood up.</p>

    <p>“But I haven’t even said anything yet…”</p>

    <p>“And I don’t want to hear anything! I still haven’t recovered from our
        last adventure. I. Need. Peace!”</p>

    <p>“Come on, it was fun!”</p>

    <p>“It was fun right up until you caused a quantum fluctuation that sucked my Dads truck into a BLACK HOLE!”</p>

    <p>“You’re the one who let me drive it!” <a class="more"><b>More...</b></a>
    </p>

    <div class="end">
        <p>“Oh, so it’s my fault?”</p>

        <p>“Well, I’ve only driven ships...”</p>

        <p>Stephen stopped weeding the garden and looked up at Sofia.</p>

        <p>“What kind of ship?”</p>

        <p>“ A spaceship. I don’t own one myself… but I know where I could get
            one.”</p>

        <p>“I see...” Stephen grinned as he reluctantly continued weeding. “You
            know, it’s thanks to you that my parents are making me pull every weed
            from garden as punishment; my dad is picking the truck up from the
            garage as we speak. Why did we even want to go joyriding anyways? I
            can’t even remember. Why do I always end up being the one who is
            punished while you’re off coming up with new ideas for your next
            adventure?”</p>

        <p>Sofia let Stephen continue rambling and grumbling because his gripes
            were extremely entertaining to her. Also, she knew that, deep down
            in the bottom of his heart, he loved the adventuring and was always
            up for more. A smile crept across her face as she helped him to
            finish the chores.</p>

        <p>"There's an old merchant-bot on the island who is selling his old
            ship. If we buy it, we can use it to reach the nearest island! Have
            you ever been to any islands besides ours?"</p>

        <p>Stephen didn’t respond.</p>

        <p>"There are five massive islands surrounding us. Aren’t you the least
            bit interested in seeing what's out there? Maybe hairless monkeys
            manage things instead of robots on those islands, or maybe monkeys
            do the weeding and the robots are their pets. What if we could
            rescue them?!"</p>

        <p>"Where would you get the money to buy the old ship?"</p>

        <p>"I can use my new credit card."</p>

        <p>"But you don’t even know how to use an ATM."</p>

        <p>"Oh, I'm sure it's SUPER complicated…"</p>
    </div>
</div>


<p>
    Teach Sofia how to use an ATM. The ATM on their home island can only dispense
    $5 bills which means that the machine will not dispense any amount of money
    that is not divisible by $5. In addition to that, the bank fee for each
    withdrawal is $1. The robots cannot withdraw any amount above the card’s
    balance or negative value.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Input:</strong> Two arguments: the first one denotes the robot’s
    account balance, and the second is a list of the monetary amounts that the
    robot wants to withdraw.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output:</strong> The account balance after all operations. An integer.
